MATLAB files to produce MBNs, calculate their motif distributions and plot the results.
Tuomo M&auml;ki-Marttunen, 2016

Files included:

mbn.m
-The script for creating an MBN of given size, in-degree distribution and motif preference

givemotifs.m
-The script for calculating the three-node motif distribution

calcmotres.m
-The script for creating MBNs of each type. Saves the results to Mots_mean.mat. Takes a
 while, depending on the number of samples (by default Nsamp=20, in the article Nsamp=200 used).
 In a standard laptop using single CPU thread, calculation with Nsamp=20 took 2 hours to finish.

drawmotres.m
-The script for plotting the results.



To calculate and plot the results corresponding to Figure S2, run the following commands in the directory including all files:

calcmotres;
drawmotres;
